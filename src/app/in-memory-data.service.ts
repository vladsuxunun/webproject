The beach views, calm ocean and ability to watch the sunset on our patio were highlights of the trip! The hotel restaurant was exceptional, not only because every meal we enjoyed had a variety of options and was flavorful but also because the prices were so reasonable for an oceanfront resort! The entire island and resort were a lot more laid back and calm than other touristy coastal front towns in the southeast, but that may in part due to it being early March. I would imagine there is a bit more traffic during high seasons, but either way, we will definitely be back! Highly recommended!', username:'Maya', restaurantId:3}
